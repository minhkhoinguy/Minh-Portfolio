# Minh-Portfolio

I WANT to create a Portfolio page to introduce myself to employers.

WHEN i open the website, all my information will appear.

WHEN i click on the shortcuts on the header , takes me to specific places on the page.

WHEN i click 'See more' , 'My Project' will show/close.

WHEN i click on the names/images in 'My Project' , takes me to the web page of the project I clicked on.

WHEN i click on the items in 'Contact Me' , takes me to the links corresponding to that item.
